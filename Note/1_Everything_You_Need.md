Welcome to module 1 of the Painting with Plotters Course! In this module, we will cover every(physical)thing you need to make plotter paintings. It will have multiple parts. 

In part 1, let's talk about machines! Plotters, computers, and how to prepare them for painting! 

If you want to try the 3D-printed plotter base, [The STL file of the model is stored in the repository.](https://github.com/LiciaHe/painting_with_plotters/tree/master/Projects/1_machines_materials_tools/3D_models/Axidraw_Base_Block_default.stl). There will be a video in the future explaining how this was made so you can customize it for your own plotter.
