# Painting with Plotters
## About this Course 
**Painting With Plotters** is a sequence of video and text tutorials that introduce Licia He's method for making generatively-designed, plotter-rendered paintings using a variety of water-based paint. Through this course, I (Licia) share how I make my plotter paintings, and why I make them in this way. Painting with plotters, or other types of robot, requires design efforts from different aspects: the preparation of machines, the selection of material, the making of the design, and the machine operation. This course aims to provide an in-depth presentation of Licia's research and practice in these aspects. 

## Course Plan (Subject to Change)

The course contains 14 modules. Each module contains one or more video tutorials. Some modules will contain discussion of software development. Although all course materials are developed for Axidraw and Python, most of the content could be applicable for other machines and design environment.

### Disclaimers/Note
1. The course primarily focuses on my (Licia's) plotter painting practice.  Audiences will have to adopt and adjust according to their own setup. This is especially important regarding machine operation. Always follow instructions and safety rules provided by your machine. 
2. The course is free and open to all. Unless otherwise mentioned, none of the materials/machines shown in the course is sponsored.
