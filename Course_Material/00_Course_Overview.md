# Painting with Plotters

<h2 class="author"><a href="http://eyesofpanda.com" target="_blank">Licia He</a></h2>

## About this Course 

**Painting With Plotters** is a virtual course that introduces Licia He's method for making generatively-designed, plotter-rendered paintings using a variety of water-based paint. Painting with plotters (or other types of robots) requires design efforts from different aspects:

1. the preparation of machines
2. the selection of material
3. the making of the design
4. the machine operation. 

The course aims to provide an in-depth presentation of Licia's research and practice in these aspects. It contains 14 modules. Each module includes video tutorials, notes, and code snippets. Although all course materials are developed for [AxiDraw](https://axidraw.com/) and using [Python](https://www.python.org/), most of the content could apply to other machines and design environments.

_**Latest Update:** Module 1 Part 1 Releases on Dec 26th, 2024._
