## Exporting svg files 
1) Inkscape 
2) Illustrator
3) Other methods (skip)

## Producing svg files:
1) Through an editor

1. basics of SVG (header: width, height, view box, xmlns.): The xmlns attribute in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) stands for "XML Namespace." It is used to define the XML namespace for the SVG document. An XML namespace is a way of identifying and differentiating XML elements and attributes with the same name but different meanings. 
2. XML (Extensible Markup Language)

[SVG reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
[d string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d)

Introducing 
1) path: M, L, Z  (check if inkscape actually does this)
2) attributes: fill, stroke, stroke-width, opacity
3) 

## Producing python script

[pyaxidraw](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/#introduction)
1. Connect to plotter and move. 
2. Adjust different options 
3. Name Axidraw
4. Produce a super simple instruction


setting options
[name your axidraw](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/#write_name)

list_names	Read USB "nickname" or port of all attached machines
read_name	Read the USB "nickname" of the AxiDraw
write_name	Write the USB "nickname" of the AxiDraw


## Compare both methods 
SVG: no need to programming, authored with many programs. Visible
Python: more control, easy running process, handle complex & large files. Flexible.
