### Todos before the next module:

- If you want a more detailed overview of what we are going to cover in this course, reading my article [20+ Questions About My Plotter Painting Practice](https://www.eyesofpanda.com/project/plotter_painting_q_a/) can be a good start. This course is an expanded version of this article.
- Search for keywords like "plotter art" and "pen plotter" to find some plotter works and plotter artists you like.
- It's never too late to learn to code. We are going to start coding in module 3. If you want to pick up creative coding, or want to refresh some python basics, now it's a great time! 
- If you have any questions or suggestions, [let me know by filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAMLVMtuUR2i5G695Mufm0polT8fs-n0bQurwLId-2cLDx7Q/viewform?usp=sharing).



I will see you in the next module. Happy plotting!
